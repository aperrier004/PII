## Installation
### Installing the Python environment
If you don't already have a Python environment on your computer, you can:
download a version of Python (the project works in version 3.8.1): `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
then download an IDE like PyCharm at this address: `https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/pycharm/download/#section=windows` if you don't want to go through the command line installation, ignore the next paragraph

### Installing the application from the command line
Clone the project at the following address: `https://github.com/aperrier004/PII` (or download the code then unzip the archive)
Open a terminal and go to the project folder “`PII`”(with the command `cd`)
Type the following command :
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Start the application with the command: `python main.py`
You arrive on the first screen, select a .json file (`bibouleJump.json` for example), then click on the “Show Graphs” button, a new window will appear and you will be able to view the data.

### Installing the application with an IDE
Clone the project at the following address: `https://github.com/aperrier004/PII` (or download the code then unzip the archive)
Open your IDE for Python and open the project by selecting the “`PII`” folder
Select or configure a compatible Python interpreter (version 3.8 for example)
Select “`requirements.txt`” as the dependency file to install them
Wait for all the dependencies to download and the project to load with its components, this may take a few minutes
Open the file “main.py`”
Click on the "Run" tab in the menu bar, then on "Run"


### Using data from GazePlay
If you are a user of GazePlay software (available here : `https://gazeplay.github.io/GazePlay/en`), you can use your own .json data files directly by selecting them in the application.
You can find one with a default install path here: `C:/Users/[USERNAME]/GazePlay/statistics/[GAME_NAME]`
